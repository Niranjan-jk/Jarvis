## Description

Welcome to your very own Jarvis-inspired voice assistant! This Python program enables you to communicate with your AI assistant using voice commands. It leverages the power of OpenAI's GPT-3 to understand and respond to your requests.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

- Python installed on your system.
- Required Python packages installed. You can install them using `pip`:

   ```bash
   pip install speech_recognition pyttsx3 openai python-dotenv
An OpenAI API key for seamless interaction with your assistant. Store it in a .env file.

Usage
Clone this repository to your local machine.

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/jarvis-voice-assistant.git
Navigate to the project directory.

bash
Copy code
cd jarvis-voice-assistant
Run the Jarvis Voice Assistant:

Start the assistant by running:

bash
Copy code
python chatgptva.py
This script listens to your voice commands and interacts with GPT-3 to provide responses.

In a separate terminal, start the speech-to-text component:

bash
Copy code
cd voice_assistant
python speech_to_text.py
This script converts your speech to text and writes it to a file.

Follow the prompts and interact with your assistant just like Tony Stark's Jarvis!

Sample Conversation
Here's a sample conversation you can try with your voice assistant:

You: "Jarvis, provide me with a weather update for today."
Assistant: "Of course, sir. The weather forecast for today is as follows..."
You: "Thank you, Jarvis. Can you also schedule a meeting for 2 PM?"
Assistant: "Certainly, sir. Your meeting is scheduled for 2 PM."
You: "Jarvis, play some relaxing music, please."
Assistant: "As you wish, sir. Playing relaxing music now."
Feel free to extend the conversation and enjoy your interactions with Jarvis!
